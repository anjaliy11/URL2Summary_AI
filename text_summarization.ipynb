The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others.

      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development by fulfilling the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and rural areas\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agriculture and food production\n",

      "9. Defending the nation\n",
      "10. Launching a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He specifically recalled a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. Kalam assured her that it was a thought-provoking question and that he was committed to making India a developed nation in a short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the questioner's thoughtfulness and assured them that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, where efforts would be made to work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of the youth in India to live in a developed and prosperous nation. The speaker reflects on their experiences meeting over 15 lakh youth, who represent the dreams of the 540 million youth in India. The speaker emphasizes that the aspirations of the young should guide their profession.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the importance of empowering villages in India, using the example of a visit to Nagaland in 2002. The speaker witnessed a prosperous village with an empowered council and discussed the need to provide physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the speech mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex in 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative provides three types of connectivity: physical, electronic, and knowledge, leading to economic connectivity. The PURA complex includes healthcare centers, education facilities, and vocational training centers, resulting in large-scale employment generation and the creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of a sustainable economic development model in the Periyar PURA villages. The key achievements include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, enabling villagers to cultivate various crops and plants, including Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants.\n",
      "2. Establishment of marketing centers and food processing facilities, providing employment opportunities and generating income for the villagers.\n",
      "3. Collaboration with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, which has enabled the development of 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products.\n",
      "4. Enhanced innovative ability among the villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker believes that this model, known as PURA (Protsahan Udyami Rashtriya Abhiyan), has the potential to bridge the rural-urban divide and requires establishment in 7000 villages across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech by an unknown speaker discusses the importance of agriculture in the nation. They share a personal anecdote about meeting over 6,000 farmers at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they expressed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with reduced land, water, and manpower, and to improve the nation's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They mention a national symposium where they discussed practical suggestions from farmers to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares a story about meeting a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he exuded happiness and confidence. When asked what he needed from the speaker, he replied that he wanted to sing in front of him. The speaker is inspired by Vidwan's positivity and resilience, suggesting that anyone can overcome obstacles with the right mindset and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be given by a high-ranking military officer or a government official, possibly the President of India, given the mention of \"Rashtra pati Bhavan\" (Presidency House). Here's a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a heartwarming story of a physically challenged person who has a hidden talent for music. Despite his disability, he is encouraged by his parents, teachers, and academics to pursue his passion, and eventually becomes a talented musician who wants to inspire others through his art.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shifts the focus to the resilience and indomitable spirit of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who were affected by the devastating earthquake in 2005. He visits a village called Urusa, which has been adopted by the Western Air Command, Air Force for relief and medical aid. He praises the courage and resilience of the villagers, who have overcome their problems and are rebuilding their lives despite the severe losses they suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying message of the speech is about the importance of overcoming challenges and adversity through partnership and positive attitude, as exemplified by the physically challenged musician and the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\n",
      "\n",
      "The given speech appears to be a passage from a speech by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. \n",
      "\n",
      "He discusses the courage of people in the face of natural disasters, specifically mentioning the 2005 earthquake in Jammu & Kashmir and the 2004 tsunami in Car Nicobar Islands. \n",
      "\n",
      "In both instances, he witnessed remarkable resilience and courage among the affected communities, including children and village members who actively participated in relief efforts. He also mentions a personal experience where he sang a poem called \"Sea Waves\" with the tribal islanders of Car Nicobar, who showed immense enthusiasm despite their suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech seems to highlight the importance of community spirit, courage, and the ability to transform in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, on a Pan African e-Network project. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key points from the speech:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The speech is divided into three main parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tele-consultation and African connection**: The President mentions the successful tele-consultation between doctors in Hyderabad's Black Lion Hospital and Addis Ababa's Black Lion Hospital.

      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student leader named Ms. Padma, who was inspired by the Lead India Training Camp to change her father's behavior by encouraging him to quit smoking.

      "\n",
      "In addition to his focus on rural development, Kalam emphasized the importance of agriculture and industry in driving economic growth. He met with over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories, who showed interest in sustainable agriculture practices and innovative technologies. Kalam believes that through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries, India can increase its agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",

      "Kalam's experiences have also taught him the importance of courage and resilience in the face of calamities. During his visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, he met with the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children of Chuckchucha village, who had shown remarkable courage in the aftermath of the Tsunami. He was touched by their unique trait of taking possession of affected victims as their children and composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to commemorate their bravery.\n",

      "Furthermore, Kalam's vision for Africa was a notable aspect of his tenure. He proposed the Pan African e-Network, a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of US $ 100 million. The project aimed to connect 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. The pilot project in Ethiopia has already seen success, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students. This initiative highlights Kalam's commitment to global development and his belief in the power of technology to bridge gaps and foster collaboration.\n",

      "In addition to his focus on development, Kalam also emphasized the importance of national security. He visited the Indian Army's Siachen Glacier, the Indian Navy's INS Sindhurakshak, and flew in a Sukhoi-30 fighter, experiencing the bravery and dedication of India's defense forces. Kalam was impressed by the vigilance and commitment of the Indian Defense Forces and para-military forces in safeguarding the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also highlighted the importance of empowering the youth. He met with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who were working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation. The foundation aimed to empower the youth to become leaders in their communities and drive positive change in India. Notably, the Lead India 2020 Foundation, created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, has made significant impact in transforming students in many districts of Andhra Pradesh, as seen in the Medak district. Students have shown self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and have shed their stage fear. A student leader, Ms. Padma, from the Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda, shared her inspiring story of weaning her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10-point oath from the Lead India Training Camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the ignited minds of the 540 million youth below the age of 25, which Kalam considers the most powerful resource on earth, he believes that empowering them through value-based education and leadership is crucial. This aligns with his vision of a developed India by 2020, as expressed by a young girl, Anukriti, who asked him to take her dream to the highest institution of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam's vision for India's future is one of a nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line, where there is an equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water, where agriculture, industry, and service sector work together in symphony, where education with a value system is not denied to any meritorious candidates due to societal or economic discrimination, and where India is the best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Kalam's experiences have taught him the importance of empowering villages, mobilizing rural core competence, and overcoming problems through partnership. He believes that these principles can drive India's growth and development, creating a prosperous and safe nation for its 540 million youth. His vision for Africa, through the Pan African e-Network, and his emphasis on national security and empowering the youth demonstrate his commitment to global development, national security, and the empowerment of the youth.\n",
